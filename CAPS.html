            <p>Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at the University of Michigan is a resource dedicated to supporting the mental health and well-being of students. CAPS offers a variety of services designed to help students navigate the challenges of college life. These services include individual counseling, group therapy, workshops, and crisis intervention. The aim is to provide a safe and confidential environment where students can address issues such as stress, anxiety, depression, relationship problems, and academic pressures.

            Students can utilize CAPS services by first scheduling an initial consultation, which can typically be done by phone or through an online portal. This initial appointment is designed to assess the student’s needs and determine the most appropriate course of action, whether that be ongoing counseling sessions, joining a therapy group, or utilizing other campus resources. It’s important to note that CAPS services are generally covered by student fees, making them accessible to all enrolled students without additional costs.
                
            The process of accessing CAPS services often requires students to complete preliminary paperwork that includes questions about their mental health history and current concerns. Once this step is completed, students meet with a counselor who will work with them to create a personalized plan. In cases where CAPS cannot meet a student's specific needs, they may provide referrals to external mental health professionals. CAPS also offers online resources and self-help tools, making mental health support more accessible even outside regular office hours. By taking these steps, CAPS aims to promote mental health awareness and provide vital support to the university community. </p>
