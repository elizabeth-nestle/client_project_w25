            <p>The Maize & Blue Cupboard is a vital program at the University of Michigan aimed at addressing food insecurity among students and promoting equitable access to nutritious food. It offers a welcoming and supportive environment where students and other members of the university community can obtain free groceries and personal items. The cupboard is stocked with a wide range of food options, including fresh produce, dairy, proteins, grains, and pantry staples, as well as hygiene products. These resources are intended to help alleviate the financial burden on students who might otherwise have to choose between buying food and covering other essential expenses like tuition or housing.</p>

            <p>To benefit from the Maize & Blue Cupboard, students simply need to make an appointment, and go to the basement of the Betsy Barbour Residence Hall (accessible via the Maynard entrance). Upon their first visit, students are required to register, a process that helps the cupboard track usage and plan accordingly but involves no complex paperwork or eligibility criteria. Once registered, students can visit the cupboard as often as needed during its operating hours, which are convenient for those balancing academic and extracurricular commitments. The cupboard also offers educational programs and workshops on nutrition and cooking, further empowering students to maintain a healthy lifestyle within budget constraints. By providing these crucial resources, the Maize & Blue Cupboard effectively supports the well-being and academic success of the university's diverse student population.</p>
